# FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis Projects

Explore my FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis Projects repository! This collection showcases my journey in the field of data analysis through projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

# Projects Included

## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project developed a Python function that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a matrix along both axes and for the flattened matrix. It provides a streamlined way to analyze multidimensional data in Python.

## Demographic Data Analyzer

This project analyzed a demographic dataset to uncover insights about factors like age, income, education, and occupation. It utilized Pandas to summarize the data.

## Medical Data Visualizer

This project explored a medical dataset through data cleaning and visualization. It utilized categorical plots and heatmaps to reveal patterns and relationships within the data.

## Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project delved into page view data, creating line charts, boxplots, and grouped charts to analyze trends across time, years, and months.

## Sea Level Predictor



This project explored two approaches to predicting sea level: 1) using data from 1880 and 2) using data from 2000. Utilized both regression models within SciPy and Sklearn for comparison.
